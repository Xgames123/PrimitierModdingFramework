# Custom substances and materials


## Creating a custom material
* call ```CustomSubstanceSystem.CreateCustomMaterial("Leaf");``` and pass in the name of the material to start from
* Modify the values of the material. NOTE: don't forget to change name to a custom name.

* To load the material in the game call ```CustomSubstanceSystem.LoadCustomMaterial(yourCustomMat);```



## Creating a custom substance
1) Before you can start creating custom substances you have to call ``` PMFSystem.EnableSystem<CustomSubstanceSystem>(); ``` This will enable the CustomSubstanceSystem. [See PMFSystems](./PMFSystems.md)

2) Next call ```CustomSubstanceSystem.CreateCustomSubstance()``` and pass in the base substance to start from.

3) Modify the values of the substance. NOTE: don't forget to change displayNameKey to a custom name.

    To change the material of your custom substance change the material property to the name of your custom material

4) To load your custom substance in the game call ```CustomSubstanceSystem.LoadCustomSubstance(yourCustomSubstance);```

## CustomSubstanceSettings
This are extra settings for your custom substances
* OnSubstanceInitialize If you set this lambda you can do stuff when the substance initializes like adding components or [ICubeBehaviors](./ICubeBehaviors.md)
* EnName is the name of the substance in English
* JpName is the name of the substance in Japanese

## Spawning a custom substance
Call ```CustomSubstanceSystem.GetSubstanceByName("YOUR_SUBSTANCE")``` to get the Substance enum for your custom substance. you can pass it into ```CubeGenerator.GenerateCube``` to generate the substance


## Substance values descriptions
SubstanceParameters.Param has a couple of misleading names.

Thanks to GracefulGal and EnderReaper64 for finding most of this

**If some one finds out more about this please message me**
* strength = health
* stiffness = damage
* density = mass per volume unit
* isflammable = is flammable
* isedible = is food
* kindlingpoint = the temperature it maxes out burning at
* collisionsound = the sound on hit (available sounds can be found in the resource dump by calling ResourceXmlDumper.DumpAllToFile();)
* displayname = the name (in game is used for localization but pmf also uses it as an id)
* material = the material (how it looks)
* combustionspeed = how fast it burns (warning: high values, even as high as 100, will cause the object to instantly vaporize and generate a LOT of heat)
* combustionheat = probably means how much heat the material makes
* heatcapacity = ???

## Custom substance builders
Custom substance builders are not required to create custom substances but it can help to organize your substances into differed classes
1) Create a class that inherits form CustomSubstanceBuilder
2) override OnBuild and add the code to create the custom substance
```cs
    public class DecayThingBuilder : CustomSubstanceBuilder
    {
        public override void OnBuild()
        {
            //Code to create the custom substance
        }
    }
```
3) add ``` PMFHelper.AutoInject(System.Reflection.Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly()); ``` to OnApplicationStart
```cs
public override void OnApplicationStart()
{
    base.OnApplicationStart();
    PMFSystem.EnableSystem<PMFHelper>();

    PMFHelper.AutoInject(System.Reflection.Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly());
    
}
```
